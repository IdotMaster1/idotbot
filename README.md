### idotbot

## Run it as a personal bot for your personal discord server like one with your friends, you can use it for public servers but its not that useful. Just follow the comments in the code and you will probably manage.

Little project I made while school holidays, was fun.

More useful bot: https://codeberg.org/phrl42/Tech-Bot
might have stole some code from it :trollface:
